This compiles valid xml to valid json, and can "pretty print" the resulting json.

The point was to experiment with some of the classic compiler techniques I've been trying to wrap my
head around.

It uses a tokenizer, parser, and "code generator".

None of the pieces are complicated because there's no "architecture" to "support" or anything, and I
haven't read the code-generation part of my compilers book yet.
